How to run the tracker

= Introduction =

Currently, we use DPM detector by Felzenszwalb et al as a baseline method. The main tracking algorithm requires to pre-process images with Matlab version of DPM detector and generate list file for images and corresponding confidence files. 


= Details =

1. Move to directory matlab
2. run "process_all_confidence" to download required packages and process images. In case, you want to track objects other than human use "process_all_confidence_object" instead. 
3. generate image and confidence list files using commands like
 ls seq02-img-left/*.jpg > seq02_imlist.txt
 ls seq02-img-left/*.conf > seq02_conflist.txt
4. modify "track.sh" in "standalone_tracker" accordingly and run the tracker.
